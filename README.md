Welcome to Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (now version 1.10 -- see book news for details), a free online operating systems book! The book is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical, including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently. Lots of fun stuff! Or maybe not so fun?

This book is and will always be free in PDF form, as seen below. For those of you wishing to BUY a copy, please consider the following:



Lulu Hardcover (v1.10): this may be the best printed form of the book (it really looks pretty good), but it is also the most expensive way to obtain the black book of operating systems (a.k.a. the comet book or the asteroid book according to students). Now just: $39.75
Amazon Softcover (v1.10): Same book as softcover above, but printed through Amazon CreateSpace. Now just: $28.27 (but works with Prime shipping)
Downloadable PDF (v1.10): this is a nice convenience and adds things like a hyperlinked table of contents, index of terms, lists of hints, tips, systems advice, and a few other things not seen in the free version, all in one massive DRM-free PDF. Once purchased, you will always be able to get the latest version. Just: $10.00
Kindle (still v1.00): Really, just the PDF and does not include all the bells and whistles common in e-pub books.
Warning: Some resellers on Amazon buy old versions of the books and claim to sell them as “new” on Amazon (click here for an example); buy from them at your own risk. In general, buy either directly from Lulu.com or Amazon.com (not a reseller). For Amazon, go to this page and look for Seller Information to be Amazon.com.

Merch: Can't bear to go out in public without OSTEP? How about an Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces T-shirt or laptop sticker or bathmat or blanket or mug or check out the whole store?

Donate: By popular demand, another way to support this site and its contents: donate! Click to donate $1 - $10 - $20 - $50 - or click here to donate any amount you want!

INSTRUCTORS: If you are using these free chapters, please just link to them directly (instead of making a copy locally); we make little improvements frequently and thus would like to provide the latest to whomever is using it. Also: we have made our own class-preparation notes available to those of you teaching from this book; please drop us a line at ostep.book@gmail.com if you are interested.

HOMEWORKS: Some of the chapters have homeworks at the end, which require simulators and other code. More details on that, including how to find said code, can be found here: HOMEWORK

PROJECTS: While the book should provide a good conceptual guide to key aspects of modern operating systems, no education is complete without projects. We are in the process of making the projects we use at the University of Wisconsin-Madison widely available; an initial link to project descriptions is available here: PROJECTS. Coming soon: the automated testing framework that we use to grade projects.

BOOKS NEWS: Many small things to move to version 1.10. Track changes: NEWS

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: These students have greatly contributed to this effort, through endless bug reports and other comments. Your name could go here! (as well as in the printed book): ERRATA

OTHER SYSTEMS BOOKS: Interested in other systems books? Good! Of course, we assume some background in The C Programming Language, so that's a good investment. And Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment is a must for any shelf. On top of that, here are some OS books that could be worth your time: Operating Systems: Principles and Practice - Operating System Concepts - Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles (8th Edition) - Modern Operating Systems (4th Edition) - Linux Kernel Development (3rd Edition) - Understanding the Linux Kernel - The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System - Solaris Internals: Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris Kernel Architecture - Mac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach - The Design of the UNIX Operating System - UNIX: The Textbook - The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook.
